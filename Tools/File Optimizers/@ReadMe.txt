/* Ultimate Packer for eXecutable (UPX) */
Repacks your executable to compress it's size. To use, drop your executable on the tool.
/!\ Choose safety and save your executable prior use in the program. /!\

/* Radical Image Optimization Tool (RIOT) */
Permits to re-encode and compress (when possible) a given image either automatically or manually. To use:

Automatic: Launch the program, click 'Batch' (3 floppy disks icon at the top-left corner), click 'Add images', browse where your image is located and select it. Now look at the bottom of the window and browse the destination folder (where the compressed image will be saved). When you are done, you can click the start button on the bottom-right corner.
	Note1: You can apply few alterations to the exported image; which can be found in the 'Additional tasks' just at the left of the 'Add images' button.
	Note2: You can also set an automatic mode on the main window. Select the application mode to 'Auto, suggest format' at the top-right corner.
		/!\ Choose safety and click 'No' when the program asks you to replace the image. A custom save window will then show up. /!\

Manual (advanced users): Once your image is imported, you can control the compression settings with the options located at the bottom. A certain amount of formats can be read, but the export apparently only supports PNG, JPEG and GIF. Tweak the options to get a maximum compression with the least loss in quality. You can also apply alterations (rotation, resize (resolution), compress to size (KiB) etc...) to the image with the options at the bottom right corner.
