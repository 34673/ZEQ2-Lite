/*Audio*/
	-- Adapt audio processing to ZEQ2-Lite's context: x
	-- Discontinue OGG and Vorbis supports: -
		Note: Opus works like a charm, it seems. Time to get all the lookups changed and the two of them will have to retire after many years of loyal services!
	-- Make tracker support: x
		Note: now that is a crazy idea, but it is also immensely powerful. We might just want to add a support for existing tracker formats, such as .mod or .it etc...

/*Renderer*/
	-- Think about IQM static mesh encoding: x
		Note: files containing no rig/animations are heavier than their equivalent in MD3. That is probably due to the storage of additional data in the IQM specifications, such as vertex weight and custom attributes. Ideally, we might want to enhance the encodec modularity-wise. Not especially needed, but a good worker never runs out of tasks!
	-- Check image formats supports: x
		Note: PCX and Targa are plain outdated. Probably better to only keep lossless PNG and lossy JPEG format at the moment. Ideally, Flif would be the candidate as the ultimate storage format for images. The decoder would need to be translated from C++ to Ansi C (C89).
	-- Prepare implementation of RendererGL2/GLSL: x
    
/*Libs*/
	-- Check libraries and/or merge closely related: -

/*FileSystem*/
	-- Use default config file if null in current directory: x
		Note: drop error if default can't be found.
	-- Make certain system cvars portable across directories: x
		Note: avoiding complex overrides between config files.

/*Structure*/
	-- Rework semantic: -
	-- Establish (Zios?) coding standards: x
	-- Figure out separate mesh/animations solution: x
		Note: assignable animation sets on single mesh

/*Others*/
	-- Figure out quicker module reload method (if possible): x
	-- Implement Unicode: x

//=====================================
//QVM
//=====================================

/*CGame*/
	-- Improve Tier system: -
	Note: universal reuse of previous tier content and very default content if none in tiers.
	-- Think about HUD use and design: x
	-- Enhance specific audio lookups: x
	-- Think about accurate footsteps solution: x
	-- Enhence PSYS and GRFX (if possible): x
	-- Check events: x
		Note: cleaning, mainly.
	-- Think about Alex's aura concept: x
		Note: need GL2 renderer.
	-- Fix 'showLight' aura keyword: x
	-- Add pain sounds support: -

/*Game*/
	-- Fix pmove and think about improvements: -
	-- Fix ballflip animation: -
	Note: stay locked in.
	-- Fix server-side Tier system issues: x
		Note: stuck on tier1 when using state bug.
	-- Fix animation that comes after releasing a beam and falling: x
	-- Think about moveset and animations: -
	-- Move pain sounds support to CGame: x
	-- (code not yet parsed)

/*BothGames*/
	-- Think about environment destruction method: -

/*UI*/
	-- Major redesign: -
	-- Mobile type navigation for camera settings: x
	-- Figure out about audio play during loading screen: x
		Note: might require C11's threading features for a clean flow.
	-- Move toward new server browser (if needed): x

/*Directory-wise*/
	-- Think about baseDir UI design: -
		Note: entry point for sagas (directory menu).
	-- Think about per-directory needs: -
		Note: content restructuration, basically.

//=====================================
//Tools
//=====================================
-- Check, add or improve tools: -
-- Move to MinGW-w64/MSys2: -

//=====================================
//Others
//=====================================
-- Major cleaning (irrelevent/unused/obsolete code): -
-- Fix lens flare loading/display: x
    Note: needs investigations. Map lens flares aren't drawing anymore for some reasons...
