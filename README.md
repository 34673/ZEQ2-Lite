# ZEQ2-Lite "Overhaul" Fork

This fork of ZEQ2-Lite's official SVN mirror was set up to make my on-going works available to the public the time everything is ready for an official merge.

# Plans
This potential 1917th revision has for goal a pretty deep overhaul of the project. Deep as in working on each and every aspects of it.
It is meant to provide new means to produce better content and a more efficient "course" for learning on the various domains of interactive 2D/3D software development.

Engine side, some amount of redesigning are planned, and researches are made from time to time to bring the best libraries and techniques possibly integratable to a set of deep systems usable by the product developers.
In fact, one of the steps in that redesign is to push back broad-usage systems into the engine that will be the base for products to be made. Right now, the Virtual Machine code is where the product code is supposed to lay; temporarilly again.
To my knowledge, while ensuring portability, the Quake Virtual Machines are a severe hit performance-wise, and were originally meant for purely scripted events. The conclusion is that they may not be useful in the future. This is to be discussed though.
Another step in the redesign is to make the code as modular and abstracted as possible for the sake of simplicity, longevity and maintenance. It is about finding objectively efficient solutions to improve the development experience on any field.
For reaching that goal of efficient and convivial production based upon a powerful and simplified base, an improved set of tools (solutions, encodecs, file packers/optimizers etc...) are gathered to improve the workflows and help completing the engine.

... to be completed (see the task list for a better insight of what is going on)
