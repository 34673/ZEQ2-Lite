# ZEQ2-Lite "Overhaul" Fork

This fork of ZEQ2-Lite's official SVN mirror was set up to make my on-going works available to the public the time everything is ready for an official merge.

# Plans
This "revision 1917" has for goal a complete overhaul of at least the source and tools, if not the complete repository; providing new means to produce better content and a more efficient "course" for learning on the various domains of software development.

Engine side, researches of more modern and efficient libraries and the designing of more powerful, modular sub-systems are made to get the best means of production available to modders and developpers.

The Virtual Machines, or later probably compiled libraries will contain the product's code. Going further in the separation with the engine has for purpose to have a clean project built upon a powerful, accesible base.

Tools are being under heavy reworking. The goal is to permit as much jobs/tasks as possible to profit of programs or scripts to help in their workflow. It goes from more recent compilers to optimization tools and encodecs.

... to be completed (see the task list for a better insight of what is going on)
